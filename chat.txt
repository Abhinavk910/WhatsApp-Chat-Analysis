[25/03/18, 7:42:54 PM] Hitesh: Manohar Parrikar's words while  he is under treatment for Pancreatitis in US Hospital 

Life has given me abundant political respect and it has become synonymous with my name .
However as I have noticed ,  except my work I  rarely had any other moments of enjoyment . Only my political status has remained a reality .

Today in this bedridden state I  introspect my life ...the popularity and wealth and that I thought to be milestones of life ..and the  inflated ego...all of it appears to be jaded and meaningless as I stand facing the death .

With each passing second as the death creeps to me stealthily , I see the green lights of lifesaving machines around me , their humming noise makes me realize my proximity to death .
At this critical moment   I have understood that there is so much more to life than accumulating  wealth and fame .....social service and  managing our relationships with others whom we like  are few things not to be missed .

I realize that of all the political success  that I have earned , i can carry nothing  with me . 

This bed of sickness is the  most exclusive  bed as nobody can   use it  except yourself . You can have servants , drivers , employees to serve and earn for you but none to share your sickness.

All the things that are lost can be found or earned back but what cannot be retrieved is .....
time....
As you run through the rat race of life persuing success one must realise that at some point of time you have to reach  the last part of drama in the theatre where end of thev show is visible .

So .. learn to first look after yourself , take care of others, 
Learn to spend your money and shower your feelings on  people around you .

When a child is born he is weeping and when he dies others are weeping 
So friends  Lets have all the laughter and fun time in between before we call it a day .
MANOHAR PARRIKAR

[17/05/18, 2:48:04 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Hey My dear Friends
I reached home around 11.30. As soon as I entered my home the very first thing which i showed to my parents was photo frames and yesterday's farewell photos and videos at station and it was very emotional instance for me as well as for them. They were so much happy for me bz in 2014 I entered IIT alone but i left IIT with family of 12 loving, amazing and caring friends. Someone has said rightly that friendship is the purest form of love. You guys gave me so much love and attention which i never got from anyone except my parents. I was stupid at many times and made mistakes but you guys still supported and loved me. Till 3rd year my life was very confined and i didnt know how to live real life and i was thinking reading life changing books will change my life but i was wrong. It was you people who transformed my life and prepared me and in that process i learned a lot of things from each and evey one of u 12 guys. I am really gonna miss all those trips,ek saath mess jana, bakar, pranks, campus walks, birthday chapos, college fests mai saath jana, success celebrations and most important u r companionship. These four years were like roller coaster ride full of fun, energy, thrills and excitement accompanied by u people. 
Yaar aate wakt toh tum sab log mere liye station aaye the yaar mujhe kabhi bhi life mai itna pyaar nahi mila tha. Thanks a lot for such lovely farewell. Rakshit teri toh tabiyat kharab thi phir bhi tu aaya tha thank u very much yaar aur first year se tere saath reh ke hi research karna ka motivation mila hai. 

Finally Sorry sabko agar meri galti ki vajah se koi hurt hua ho toh. 


Thank you each and everyone of u for everything. And stay in touch

[22/05/18, 3:37:22 PM] Sparsh Jain: So, I was just wondering today that yeah we do have great bonding and love among us... But what does our group looks like from an outsider's perspective in technical terms... I mean what is our group's net worth in terms of individual acheivements...
I started thinking about it and Woah! the answer was huge...
[22/05/18, 3:38:41 PM] Sparsh Jain: In our group, we have 3 branch changers, one A-list coder, 2 A-list data scientists, people going to companies like Schlum, GS, Paypal, Amex, Exxon, ZS... Not just relying on placements we have a PPO holder, a PhD candidate from one of the top US university and an IIM going graduate... 
Talking about core... Haha we have GATE AIR 16 bitches, no discussion required there...
We have an all time go to person for finance... We have top position holders in HEC, ChESS, IIChE, AIChE, DSG... Not just acads or currics, we have sportspersons in Cricket, Badminton, Volley, Skating as well...
[22/05/18, 3:40:46 PM] Sparsh Jain: I know you must be thinking that all of us already know all of this, so what's the point of putting it out there...
I just thought that it might be good that if we could sit and appreciate our group from this angle as well in addition to the millions of other angles we already do... 😇😇
[22/05/18, 3:41:17 PM] Nishant: Someone I guess missed DR 1 and DR2 and gate rank 50😃

When I was in class 7 , I used to ask a lot of questions. .....!
    One day, I asked my English Teacher, "Why do we ignore some letters in pronunciation eg. the letter H .......in Hour, Honour. .....etc. ......??????
My English Teacher said, " We are not ignoring them;  they're considered silent ".......
       (I was even more confused .....?????)
   During the lunch break, my Teacher  gave me her packed lunch and asked me to heat it in the Cafeteria. 
   I ate all the food and returned her the empty container. ....!!!!!!!
  My English Teacher : What happened?  I told you to go and HEAT my food, you are returning me an empty container.
   I replied,  "Madam, I thought 'H' was silent.  

Dedicated to all English Teachers.😂😂

[18/06/18, 10:54:59 PM] Abhishek Pathak: #Disclaimer: serious post

Hey bhailog... Sorry yaar main bahot time se baat nhi kar rha hu... and generally kisi video chat p bhi nhi aata.. and group p bhi kuch nhi baat karta..primarily kyunni abbi job application n interview chal rhe h...will let u know as soon as I fetch something good...

Nevertheless....I am seeing ki abhi dhere dhere sabhi ki job shuru ho rhi h.. to I just wanted to say a few things...

Wish you all the very best yaar sabhi ko...I know that all of you have worked very hard these years to be where you are  today... Mujhe hamare rajendra bhawan ka day 1 yaad aa rha hai jab pancholi sir ne sabhi ko A-Block bulaya tha shaam ko... to just greet us and all.. and he said one thing jo aaj bhi kind of mujhe yaad hai.. he said ki "now you have reached the top...but you know what's more difficult than reaching the top.. it's staying at the top"

I really feel ki all of us should embody this thought...because it's so prevalent in this professional life..there is also this great line by Jack Welch (businessman) - " if the rate of the change on the outside is greater than the rate of the change on the inside.. your end is near"... I read this quote like bahot hi jyada frequently because it's soo soo true and apt in real life and motivates me to work hard everyday irrespective of what I have done or achieved...to make sure that I don't get obsolete...so I would just like request everyone.. ki within your professional discipline or if u want even out of its bounds...please please always keep learning and growing and developing...

I also remember very vividly that I got an advice very early on from one of my senior during my first internship.. he was an IIT KGP CSE grad and just like all of us got placed at a reputed firm..and after their training and all... the recent hires were given their first project that was to be completed within 1.5 months...somehow this chap was so smart that he finished it off in a month.. and then just wasted the rest of his time until everyone's project was done... and after a year or so came a time...when these awards were being distributed... he got the best performer award (coz he was really very efficient) but the promotion to become a product manager was given to someone else...

And there he told me this one line that still ding in my head - "every day counts"... especially in private sector... where you have to perform daily to be able to deserve the respect that you get...so what I learnt was that after some point.. results don't really that much...what matters is that one should constantly thrive and work hard...

Also, life mein in general... jab mood sahi hota to shayad sab sahi hi lagta h..even if someone asks for a favour.. we will do that happily... isiliye kyunki ham khush hote h us time...but jab cheezein hamare hisaab se nhi chal rhi hoti.. jab mood ekdum fucked up hota h..will we help someone at that moment ?...i think we should try to like retain that much goodness in ourselves specially in those difficult times...kyunki ham mein se kisi ko acha nhi lagega when we really want omeone's help urgently and he denies kyunki uska moond khraab h...to I guess hamara mood bhale hi shayad hamare control m na ho.. kyunki mood tip off bahot jaldi ho jata h.. but doosre logon k liye hamara behavior kaisa hona hona chahiye...woh to ham ache se control kar sakhte h... I firmly believe that we can .. and we should do this bit for others...

Plus yaar corporate mein most of the times we are either so overwhelmed by the opportunities ahead of us or are somewhat a little lost in the hustle and bustle of life...so much so that we tend to forget what are those things... that really matter the most to us... To I would request you all... firstly to always ask yourself ki what exactly is that you want... Could be professional success or self development or happiness satisfaction enjoyment....anything that you cannot part away with...koi aise cheez joki bas chahiye hi chahiye kisi bhi halat mein... and once you have finalised that... keep asking yourself yaar ki "am I on the right track"...Just time to time.. do some bit of self  introspection yaar to make sure that you are actually getting what you want the most from life...I know thoda ajeeb stuff hai... but I hope it works out well for all of u... 

Finally the most important stuff...There have been times when people asked me ki like "yaar tu ghante ghante bhar baat kaise kar leta h parents se... hamari to maximum 15-20 min hi ho pati h".. not to mention that I am really comfortable and habitual talking to someone for  long hours..but apart from this..one of the main reason why I talk so much and so frequently with my parents when I m out somewhere...is because very early on in my relationship I realized that mere parents ko exactly waisa lagta h jab main unse baat nhi karta hu ya khraab se baat karta hu.... Jaisa mujko feel hota h when I am not able to talk to shruti.. and as I wait all day to talk to her hoping that ham log bahot ache se baat karenge...my parents feel the same way about me.. and I guess everyone's parents feel the same way or even more for their children...

So while you are busy in your life..just remember that someone waits their entire day to just listen to you speak....please never deprive them of this happinesses.. irrespective of whatever it is you are doing however fucked up you are.. please always talk to your parents...I feel rest everything is in place ...

#good_to_go

miss you all yaar...I never thought I would feel this... but I miss being with all of you a lot more than I miss being with shruti...I really wish that all of us stay in touch with each other...

Good luck mates !

[26/06/18, 11:13:09 PM] Sparsh Jain: Yaar ek query chal rahi hai dimag mein kuch time se... Please give your opinion on it. 😅
[26/06/18, 11:13:21 PM] Rakshit Jain: Bol?
[26/06/18, 11:13:21 PM] Sparsh Jain: If Earth is continuously getting energy from Sun and energy is conserved in universe, then what is the way of energy outlet from the earth... Coz otherwise that would result in an unstable system leading to infinite energy in future.
[26/06/18, 11:14:10 PM] Rakshit Jain: Energy in the universe toh phir bhi same rahi naa?
[26/06/18, 11:14:20 PM] Rakshit Jain: Bas ek jagah se duusri jagaah hi toh gayi
[26/06/18, 11:14:38 PM] Sparsh Jain: Haan but on earth toh increase hoti rahegi na!!!
[26/06/18, 11:15:02 PM] Rakshit Jain: And unstable system toh hai hi... People have hypothesized the exhaustion of the sun.... Jab uski energy khatam ho jayegi
[26/06/18, 11:15:03 PM] Sparsh Jain: Leading to infinite energy on earth*
[26/06/18, 11:15:49 PM] Rakshit Jain: Yeh tab hoga naa agar sun mein infinite ho? Sun mein bhi finite hai
[26/06/18, 11:16:19 PM] Sparsh Jain: Sun ki energy regenerative nahi hai?
[26/06/18, 11:16:25 PM] Rakshit Jain: And anyway, earth bhi radiate karta hi hai energy... Bas, yeh hai ki kam karta hai. Ki itni nahi hoti ki kuch illuminatio. Kar paaye
[26/06/18, 11:16:30 PM] Rakshit Jain: No... Fixed hai
[26/06/18, 11:16:50 PM] Rakshit Jain: Fission regenerative nahi hoti naa.. jab lead aa jayega tab toh fission khatam ho jaata hai
[26/06/18, 11:17:03 PM] Rakshit Jain: *illuminate
[26/06/18, 11:17:37 PM] Sparsh Jain: Haan but agar aur hydrogen input hota rahega to process continuous rahega
[26/06/18, 11:17:49 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, but hota nahi hai naa
[26/06/18, 11:18:01 PM] Sparsh Jain: Ohkay...
[26/06/18, 11:18:21 PM] Sparsh Jain: Toh actually earth ka energy content continuously badh raha hai na?
[26/06/18, 11:18:48 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, tabhi toh global warming hoti hai....
[26/06/18, 11:19:24 PM] Sparsh Jain: Oh okay
[26/06/18, 11:19:42 PM] Rakshit Jain: Hai naa? Varna baraf ko melt karne vaali energy kahan se aauegi?
[26/06/18, 11:19:43 PM] Sparsh Jain: Haan yehi mera agla topic tha🤣
[26/06/18, 11:19:46 PM] Rakshit Jain: *aayegi
[26/06/18, 11:19:57 PM] Rakshit Jain: Hahaha....
[26/06/18, 11:20:30 PM] Sparsh Jain: Toh jo GHG emissions hain, they are just promoting global warming... Main cause is the continuous energy coming from the sun?
[26/06/18, 11:21:19 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan. The ghgs just prevent the efficient radiation of sun's energy back into space... They capture it and cheezein garam ho jaati hai icecaps pighalti hain and shit
[26/06/18, 11:22:20 PM] Sparsh Jain: Cool... Thanks be!! 😃

[30/06/18, 10:48:44 PM] Nishant: This is one of the best suspense jokes till date
😜

A Father put his 3year old daughter to bed, told her a story and listened to her prayers which ended by saying, 
"God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa."

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, "I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do."

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, "God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma."

The next day the grandmother died.

"Holy crap" thought the father, "this kid is in contact with the other side."

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, "God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy."

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, "I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?"

He said, "I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life."

She said, "You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting!"
😜😝😝😂😂

[22/07/18, 10:24:24 PM] Navneet: Bhai kevel +1 hi likha jata h
[22/07/18, 10:46:36 PM] Hitesh: 😂😂
[22/07/18, 11:08:53 PM] Rakshit Jain: Engineering I guess do cheezein hain, ek jo ham padhte hain, and ek jo asal mein hoti hai. Ham jo padte hain, that is shit. We just learn something, though essential, but with no actual relevance.

True engineering, in my opinion, can be something like a scenario where you are obviously taught the basic concepts that we are, but even after that, you are given problems, starting with simple ones, then going on to real life ones, and we are prompted to solve them. Maybe solving the real life problems and finding viable solutions to fields which need advancements is engineering
[22/07/18, 11:11:14 PM] Sparsh Jain: But yeh toh har profession ka kaam hai na... To solve problems
[22/07/18, 11:12:00 PM] Sparsh Jain: Doctor will solve health related problems, CA will solve accounts related problems, Business is supposed to solve the problems of his consumers etc
[22/07/18, 11:13:04 PM] Rakshit Jain: Toh hammein and unmein bas degree ka hi toh faraq ahi? We'll solve baaki saari science related problems... Kitni cheezein reh gayi.... Darwaaza khulte waqt aawaaz kar rha hai, usko tel daalna hai, to designing better spaceships, sab ham log hi toh karenge naa?
[22/07/18, 11:13:39 PM] Sparsh Jain: Haan yeh acha ha8
[22/07/18, 11:13:41 PM] Sparsh Jain: hai
[22/07/18, 11:14:00 PM] Rakshit Jain: Matlab I thought voh understood hoga, but yes, I missed it
[22/07/18, 11:14:16 PM] Sparsh Jain: Great answer... So engineering is solving real life problems, right?
[22/07/18, 11:15:34 PM] Himanshu Singhal: To vo definition thi na... Changing raw material to a useful good..wali..usse bhoolna h kya..😅😛
[22/07/18, 11:16:29 PM] Sparsh Jain: To make systems function in a smoother way, wherever they are!! Doctor are engineers for patients and engineers are doctors for machines!!
[22/07/18, 11:17:37 PM] Rakshit Jain: Ek cheez, Real life problems are just not restricted to everyday things, better telescope and better microscope bhi ham hi design karenge and better AI bhi.... Toh, I guess it's solving problems which we know we have and to add a part, to satisfy natural human curiosity? AI vale part ko kaise include kare, voh kaise karenge? Bas yeh thoda sa confusion hau
[22/07/18, 11:17:49 PM] Rakshit Jain: Very well put!!
[22/07/18, 11:19:46 PM] Sparsh Jain: Saala collector🤣🤣

_________________________________
....मै यादों का
    किस्सा खोलूँ तो,
    कुछ दोस्त बहुत
    याद आते हैं....

...मै गुजरे पल को सोचूँ 
   तो, कुछ दोस्त 
   बहुत याद आते हैं....
 
_...अब जाने कौन सी नगरी में,_
_...आबाद हैं जाकर मुद्दत से....😔_

....मै देर रात तक जागूँ तो ,
    कुछ दोस्त 
    बहुत याद आते हैं....

....कुछ बातें थीं फूलों जैसी,
....कुछ लहजे खुशबू जैसे थे,
....मै शहर-ए-चमन में टहलूँ तो,
....कुछ दोस्त बहुत याद आते हैं.

_...सबकी जिंदगी बदल गयी,_
_...एक नए सिरे में ढल गयी,_😔

_...किसी को नौकरी से फुरसत नही..._
_...किसी को दोस्तों की जरुरत नही...._😔

_...सारे यार गुम हो गये हैं..._
...."तू" से "तुम" और "आप" हो गये है....

....मै गुजरे पल को सोचूँ 
    तो, कुछ दोस्त बहुत याद आते हैं....

_...धीरे धीरे उम्र कट जाती है..._
_...जीवन यादों की पुस्तक बन जाती है,_😔
_...कभी किसी की याद बहुत तड़पाती है..._
  _और कभी यादों के सहारे ज़िन्दगी कट जाती है ..._😔

....किनारो पे सागर के खजाने नहीं आते, 
....फिर जीवन में दोस्त पुराने नहीं आते...

_....जी लो इन पलों को हस के दोस्त,_😁
    _फिर लौट के दोस्ती के जमाने नहीं आते ...._

*....
💐🙏🏻Happy Friendship Day💐🙏🏻

Bahut jadaa mazaa aaya tum logo kai sath
I really miss ur trips, bakar, khelna, kisse ki lena, movie dekhna, chutiyapa karna, bakchodi, kuch naya karna, ...
Main thing about ur group is that everyone is quite different
Group ki bonding kam nhi hone chahiye
Tum sab bahut ambitious ho bahut achche baat hai, but yaar agar possible ho to group ka liye kabhi thode time nikal lena
I would love to see u all at greater heights
Kabhi bhe kisse ko dhokha nhi dena
Life bahut enjoy karna
Bakchodi karte rehna
Life ma agar bakchodi kam ho to bata dena I will add spices 😛
Life mai jo bhe ho update karte rehna
I will try to remain by ur side whatever be the case
Saal mai ek bar to mil lena agr possible ho to
Try to keep this group at ur top 3 priorities
Group par kuch bhe nhi ho to Good morning he bol dena
Mazaa karna or karvana
Sorry agr mujse kabhi galti hue ho to
Dil mai koi baat nhi rakhna bol dena because ab bahut kam he milege so bonding kam nhi hone chahiye
Love u all guys ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Milte hai jaldi he
Kaash apan phir se college life enjoy kar sakte 😢😢😢😢😢
Bahut achche the yaar college life tum sab ki wejeh se
I really miss those days badly
Chal yaar aaj kai liye bahut hai

Content decide ho gaya but event se ek din Pehle studio ne mana kar diya video editing karne se. To fir luckily mujhe pata chala so I volunteered to do the entire editing part. And the video turned out to be really good, thanks to Hitesh for timely help. Everyone appreciated the video. Above all, Shankara personally thanked me.

Bhai is back on land

And need some advice regarding where to invest income to save tax

Tum logo ne kahan kahan daala hai paisa...
[08/02/19, 1:46:51 PM] Nishant: Bhai Maine fd karwa li
[08/02/19, 1:54:38 PM] Hemant: Ppf karane ki soch raha yaar mai to, agle financial year mein sochenge kuch.
Aur kisi ne karaya hai ye?
Ya aur koi option ho to bata dena koi bhai
[08/02/19, 1:56:52 PM] Hitesh: Ppf rahul ne khulaya hai

Baaki ek CA uncle ne NSC bhi suggest kiya mujhe

Toh socha ek baar tum logo se pooch lu
[08/02/19, 1:57:18 PM] Hitesh: ITR file me fd count hota hai??
🤔
[08/02/19, 1:58:20 PM] Nishant: Tax saving fd
[08/02/19, 1:58:34 PM] Nishant: Interest 6.7 percent
[08/02/19, 3:09:43 PM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai I think PPF is better option as compare to NSC and Fd
[08/02/19, 3:10:31 PM] Harsh Singhal: Mutual Fund is also a good option
[08/02/19, 3:10:49 PM] Harsh Singhal: But 2019 is a election year
[08/02/19, 3:11:18 PM] Harsh Singhal: Therefore Mutual fund mai invest mat kareyo
[08/02/19, 5:07:00 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Kitne saal ke liye hoti h ye?
[08/02/19, 5:08:57 PM] Rakshit Jain: Fd mein roi kam hota hai, toh isliye PPF is better. And mutual fund is almost always better, but harsh sahi keh raha hai, election year mein MF ki chud sakti hai, toh agar aisa hai toh next year SIP ka part bann sakte ho.....
[08/02/19, 5:10:05 PM] Harsh Singhal: And one more thing Interest earn is taxable in fd and NSC
[08/02/19, 5:10:08 PM] Harsh Singhal: Not sure
[08/02/19, 5:11:06 PM] Rakshit Jain: Shayad interim periods mein nahi hota, jab paisa nikalwate ho tab hota hai
[08/02/19, 5:11:07 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Every interest that is more than 10000/- per year is taxable
[08/02/19, 5:11:28 PM] Rakshit Jain: Per year ya maturity pe?

[19/02/19, 3:38:30 PM] Himanshu Singhal: All right everyone here comes the another event 

So Rakshit is coming back to India in June ( as sparsh said). So we can plan a trip to North East in June. If anyone else has another advice , it is welcomed. Otherwise we will move further with this. 
Why north east :- going to abroad will be costly (comparatively). So only options left are north east or UT  a&n . Both are good but north east will be more good due to more places to visit. (apart from scuba diving and beaches only jails and some  churches and history of world war is there in A&n) . 

Do acknowledge this , so that we can plan further.

[11/04/19, 6:16:20 PM] Navneet: Need a advise
[11/04/19, 6:16:44 PM] Abhishek Pathak: *given
[11/04/19, 6:17:09 PM] Navneet: How to arrange all photos of videos of old mobile into a new mobile
[11/04/19, 6:17:23 PM] Navneet: Any best way?
[11/04/19, 6:17:33 PM] Rakshit Jain: Google photos
[11/04/19, 6:17:37 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Exactly
[11/04/19, 6:17:50 PM] Rakshit Jain: Email se link ho jayega sab. Contacts vagerah bhi
[11/04/19, 6:18:05 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Create albums
[11/04/19, 6:18:15 PM] Navneet: In Google photos?
[11/04/19, 6:18:25 PM] Abhishek Pathak: That's a good way to segregate all your photos n videos
[11/04/19, 6:18:28 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Yup
[11/04/19, 6:18:48 PM] Navneet: Okk, will do today
[11/04/19, 6:18:56 PM] Navneet: Tonight*
[11/04/19, 6:19:43 PM] Navneet: But fir sab upload krna pdega
[11/04/19, 6:19:48 PM] Navneet: Usme to bhut time lgega
[11/04/19, 6:19:54 PM] Navneet: 😐😐
[11/04/19, 6:20:10 PM] Navneet: @919068695483??
[11/04/19, 6:20:18 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Use a wifi
[11/04/19, 6:20:36 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, but folder lagaa ke chhod de, jab upload ho jaye phir duusre phone mein bas email ID daalne ki derr hai
[11/04/19, 6:21:07 PM] Rakshit Jain: And uploads are almost always faster than transferring via cable
[11/04/19, 6:21:24 PM] Navneet: OK okay
[11/04/19, 6:51:05 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Or use a hoot spoot 🤪
[11/04/19, 7:08:58 PM] Hemant: Koi size limit hoti hai kya ismein? Matlab agar mere drive me kam space bacha ho to bhi upload hoga?
[11/04/19, 7:10:48 PM] Rakshit Jain: Nope, no size limit. Google photos reduces the quality of the photos, in order to give infinite storage
[11/04/19, 7:11:24 PM] Hemant: Aur fir use wapas retrieve karenge to original size me aayega ya compressed mein?
[11/04/19, 7:12:47 PM] Navneet: I think it didn't reduce quality
[11/04/19, 7:14:42 PM] Rakshit Jain: Usually reduced
[11/04/19, 7:15:07 PM] Rakshit Jain: It does.... But zyaada farq nahi padta in quality. Agar acchi hai toh acchi hi rehti hai
[11/04/19, 7:28:04 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, bt ismein bhi reduce toh hoti hi hai quality
[11/04/19, 7:50:20 PM] Sparsh Jain: doesn't*

[11/04/19, 10:16:30 PM] Harsh Singhal: I think Rivigo is an exception
[11/04/19, 10:16:47 PM] Harsh Singhal: Generally 80% Start-ups Fails
[11/04/19, 10:18:13 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Correct...so what really matters is how well you can differentiate the good ones from not so good ones.
[11/04/19, 10:18:52 PM] Harsh Singhal: Correct
[11/04/19, 10:19:03 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Rivigo still has a big completion from BlackBuck.

But abhi maine jismein invest kara h...it has no domestic competition at all.
[11/04/19, 10:19:39 PM] Abhishek Pathak: MNC will take a few years to achieve what these guys are doing at the moment.

By that time company should be big

[08/05/19, 7:32:09 PM] Sparsh Jain: Honesty is the best policy👍🏻
[08/05/19, 7:33:01 PM] Rakshit Jain: Hahaha, vahi
[08/05/19, 8:43:17 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Yoo boys, quick questions:

Whenever we go for a trip/vacation- (thanks to  Harsh and Nishant , we have iphone nad one plus), mostly people face an issue - clicking good quality pictures - with your partner, family, friends. Primarily because selfie properly nhi hoti, ya kisi stranger se bolte hain photos lene ko - to thoda sa painful sa ho jata hai.

So would you opt for a service jismein kahin trip jane se pehle - you are connected to a local photographer (at 3K per 2 hours). You can get any many pictures clicked as possible. He will be a proper photographer, with good det of equipments, and you can schedule the time, date, location for your photoshoot in advance.

Additionally, they also provide a (quite beautiful and decorative) photo album - which will have good designs, photo collages, you can add any quotes, and they will also provide a stand - so tum table types pe rkh sakhet ho.. and wall pe hang bhi kar sakhte ho.. this is optional at 2.5K

Will you opt for such service ?
[08/05/19, 8:47:23 PM] Harsh Singhal: Nope 😅😅
[08/05/19, 8:47:41 PM] Rakshit Jain: Same
[08/05/19, 8:47:50 PM] Navneet: Nope
[08/05/19, 8:48:19 PM] Sparsh Jain: Maine thode time baad reply karunga, itne saare nope ek saath ache nahi lagenge
[08/05/19, 8:49:20 PM] Rakshit Jain: The local will also be a stranger, toh weird lagta hai. Agar doston ke saath jaate hain toh bakchodi karni hoti hai toh photographer hoga toh aur weird hoga. Plus paise zyaada hain, I think. Plus trips pe sab planned nhi hota, banda instantly toh aayega nahi, prebook karna padega
[08/05/19, 8:50:00 PM] Rakshit Jain: Not to mention logon ko photo lena accha lagta hai
[08/05/19, 9:19:23 PM] Hitesh: Moreover

If JD is the person who is hiring

Then the photographer is going to be seriously underpaid
😂😝😛
[08/05/19, 9:54:04 PM] Abhishek Pathak: 😂😂
[08/05/19, 9:54:11 PM] Abhishek Pathak: thanks for your feedback boys

He said Gangtok, Darjeeling waala combo is way better than Guwahati, Shillong
[09/05/19, 11:32:34 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: Wo bola Guwahati mein kuch ghoomne ka hai nahi khaas...aur Shillong aur Cherapoonji hi hai aas paas ghoomne layak...but wo dono bhi 1-1 din type ke hai
[09/05/19, 11:33:21 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: On the other hand, Gangtok aur Darzeeling mein buhut kuch hai ghoomne layak...aur jagah bhi buhut acchhi hai
[09/05/19, 11:33:59 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: Gangtok aur Darzeeling mein 6-7 days aaram se spend kiye jaa sakte hai...kaafi kuch hai ghoomne ka

To sab galat honge but Mama sahi hoga
[14/05/19, 10:24:33 AM] Navneet: 😂😂
[14/05/19, 10:41:34 AM] Hitesh: 🤣
[14/05/19, 10:41:36 AM] Hitesh: I think she deserves to die by Jon's sword

Ya fir simply dragon se gir jaye bhen ki takki
😑
[14/05/19, 10:44:45 AM] Navneet: 😂
[14/05/19, 10:52:59 AM] Hitesh: Actually
Its his family

So may be he felt obligated to tell them

Kya pata baad me batane ka mauka mile na mile

Par ye toh hai
If he truly wanted to stop he shouldn't have told

Itna dimag wala hoke
Ye usko intuition honi chahiye thi
Ki what if this news is leaked
Aur intuition hogi bhi par kya kare

Obligations
😑
[14/05/19, 10:53:01 AM] Hitesh: Abki bar
Modi sarkar
🙏🏻
[14/05/19, 10:53:03 AM] Hitesh: Yaar
Uska dragon pel diya

Uski bandi misaandei pel di

Toh gusse me nikal gaya hoga

Which ultimately proved ki she is not the right person

Aur sala jon bhi chutiya gaya hai

Tyrion ki bhi maa ki

Saala Davos ko but hai throne pe
😆😝
[14/05/19, 10:55:40 AM] Sparsh Jain: Yeh huyi na some legit explanations...✌🏻 Characters ke baare mein baat kar rahe the apan... Yahaan toh log seedha ek dusre ki thinking par attack karne lage...!!!
[14/05/19, 10:56:59 AM] Sparsh Jain: 🙏🏻🙏🏻
[14/05/19, 10:58:44 AM] Sparsh Jain: Haan true... Obligations toh thi... But jab Varys usse discuss kar raha tha toh sunn toh leta dhang se, seedha bol diya she's my queen aur baat khatm... Uske itne andhe trust ki wajah se hi yeh disaster hua hai... He had a lot to do in his hands
[14/05/19, 11:08:08 AM] Hitesh: Bitha do throne pe*
😝
As he saved the maximum citizens

By smuggling I guess
[14/05/19, 11:08:10 AM] Hitesh: Koshish toh kar raha tha

Par kya karta
Grey worm ko aankhe dikhayi thi

Usne fuck off look de diya

Chila ke Danny ko bhi kaise rokta
Awaz hu nahi pahunchti

Bechare ki khud ki gaand fatt gayi dekh ke ki Danny andha dhund aag laga rahi hai

Winterfell ki army me na laga de

Toh fatti gand leke fall back kiya usne
😝

In a serious tone, aur innocent logo ki jaan ki hani na ho isliye fallback kiya

Gaand toh fatt gayi thi uski
Danny ke decisions dekh ke

Ab ek baar apni 6" ki sword wahan insert karega

Aur badi wali sword paet me

GOT khatam
[14/05/19, 11:16:33 AM] Hitesh: Woh toh hai hi

Chutiya to gaya hi tha
😑

Par bht jyada abhaari bhi tha

Walkers se ek baar usko bachaya
Apna dragon khoya

Night king se bachaya(though woh toh har living person ki responsibility thi)
Still pehle marne walo me se winterfell pehle fell karta toh

Usko bhi bachaya

Apni aadhi army khoyi

Bht jyada abhaari hoga may be

Isliye
🎶My queen🎶
🎶my queen🎶

Kar raha hoga

Aur haan sabse bada

Joru ki baat nahi manega toh
Raat ko khana bhi toh nahi milega
😝😝

[16/05/19, 9:35:39 PM] Shubham Jamdade: Hi Friends,
Regarding our trip,
Today Me and rahul had discussion about this.
So we are going to Darjeeling and Gangtok from 19 June to 23 June

Near by airport to Gangtok and Darjeeling is Bagdogra.

19th- we all will reach Gangtok in the evening.
20th- we will visit places in Gangtok
21st- We will do breakfast in the morning and will go to Darjeeling
21st, 22nd and 23rd - we will visit  places in darjeeling 

Rakshit will be going back on 22nd afternoon or morning back to Bagdogra from darjeeling

And rest of us will go back to bagdogra on 23rd morning or afternoon

Rough estimate of expense: 20,000 to 25,000 per person 

Any suggestions are welcome

[22/05/19, 2:59:55 AM] Hitesh: Kaise ho bhaiyo

Due to many reasons (including elevated flight rates, limited no. Of days etc), North East trip seems infeasible

Hence, a new place has been proposed

Lonavala
Matheran
Mahabaleshwar

In talks with JD for the final itinerary

Agar kisi ko koi aur jagah suggest karni ho toh bata do

We are already late

By today we are going to book tickets
[22/05/19, 3:12:02 AM] Rakshit Jain: Garmi mein mumbai leke jaa rha hai🧐
[22/05/19, 6:44:18 AM] Navneet: Yaaar😞☹️

Bhaiyon ek baar final kar lein kab tak Mumbai wala hi kar rahe hain?
And if yes, kab tak pahuchna hai and kab tak wapas nikalna hoga?
Flights ke prices badh rahe yaar. Fir north east se Mumbai shift karne mein jyada sense nahi reh jayega
[27/05/19, 12:18:03 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: Location to final hi hai AFAIK
[27/05/19, 12:19:35 PM] Hemant: To fir kab tak pahuchna hai and kab tak wapas niklenge? 
Us hisab se flights karna padega jo Mumbai ke paas mein nahi hain wo
[27/05/19, 12:23:36 PM] Sparsh Jain: I think 19 noon we'll meet in Mumbai and leave from there from 23 noon... So aane ki tickets 19 noon se pehle ki aur jane ki 23 noon ke baad ki karwa sakte ho
[27/05/19, 12:23:46 PM] Sparsh Jain: Baki JD zyada precisely bata payega
[27/05/19, 12:58:55 PM] Shubham Jamdade: Aane ka sahi hai afternoon tak 
vapas jaane ki late kar lo thoda
Hitesh around midnight ki kar raha hai

[29/05/19, 12:30:48 AM] Hitesh: Dosto

Meri yahan pe dosto se baat ho rahi thi aur they were saying Maharashtra is a bad idea

Then I searched myself

And here are the results
[29/05/19, 12:31:35 AM] Hitesh: Temp during our visit
[29/05/19, 12:31:45 AM] Hitesh: Of Raigad fort
[29/05/19, 12:33:20 AM] Hitesh: Matheran will be rainy with 28℃

A bad combo since we have to climb in grass in rain
[29/05/19, 12:34:29 AM] Hitesh: Beaches in June in Maharashtra will be hot and humid
[29/05/19, 12:34:56 AM] Hitesh: Himachal Chal lete hain

Option 2

[29/05/19, 6:26:50 AM] Sparsh Jain: Yeh toh May mein hota hoga na, june mein toh baarish shuru ho jati hai...
[29/05/19, 7:20:12 AM] Navneet: Nhi be
[29/05/19, 7:20:28 AM] Navneet: July me hoti h baarish
[29/05/19, 7:20:33 AM] Navneet: Just check kiya
[29/05/19, 10:23:17 AM] Rakshit Jain: Baarish vaarish chhodo, kahin ki bhi tickets karao, mumbai ka decide kiya tha, mumbai chalo. Bc sab switch karte rahenge aise
[29/05/19, 10:23:29 AM] Rakshit Jain: Bakchodi karni hai, kahin bhi kar lenge
[29/05/19, 10:25:34 AM] Hitesh: Option 2/3 waise bhi kaafi convenient rahega be
[29/05/19, 10:26:30 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Majority junta maharashtra trip ke support mein thi jab poocha tha...ab baar baar confuse mat ho
[29/05/19, 10:26:39 AM] Hitesh: Option 2 me
Mujhe Rakshit Rahul Hemant Navneet ko asaan padega

Harsh ko toh anyways Mumbai ya Delhi aana hi padega

JD ke paas time constraint nahi hai I guess toh woh 24 hour train pakad ke aa sakta hai

Sparsh aur Dada ka fasega
[29/05/19, 10:26:43 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Sach mein 🤦🏻‍♂
[29/05/19, 10:27:00 AM] Hitesh: Rakshit ko wapas jaane me asaani bhi hogi
[29/05/19, 10:29:17 AM] Hitesh: Baaki 2 logo ka 

Sparsh aur Dada ki flight ka fasega

Usme bhi I think 2/3 of us have coupons toh unn 2 logo ko bhi itna load nahi aayega
[29/05/19, 10:29:23 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Bro in case of option 2...
6 hrs journey from Delhi to Dehradoon + 13 hr journey from Dehradoon to Manali
[29/05/19, 10:29:53 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Which means 19 hrs + 3/4 hrs Delhi tak aane ke
[29/05/19, 10:30:04 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Buhut lamba padega
[29/05/19, 10:31:36 AM] Navneet: @918439393363 bhai bahut confuse ho tum, bhut hi jyaada☹️☹️

[29/05/19, 10:39:26 AM] Hitesh: Ussi waqt bolna tha

Anyways

Thoda sa analysis karke dekho

@918006621373 

Expert advice?
[29/05/19, 10:56:45 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Nowhere it shows 50 degree centigrade and in addition it is showing rain so weather can be pleasant and natural scenery can be good
[29/05/19, 10:57:41 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Logically after summer there cannot be grass 
Anyway we dont have to climb on grass
[29/05/19, 10:59:07 AM] Shubham Jamdade: This is the main reason you were thinking and should have mentioned first before giving any random reasons
[29/05/19, 10:59:34 AM] Himanshu Singhal: Although yahan pr bhut bhasad machi hui h...should I add my input too ?
[29/05/19, 10:59:51 AM] Hitesh: Please
🙏🏻
[29/05/19, 11:01:50 AM] Shubham Jamdade: We can go to manali also and it was my 1st preference
[29/05/19, 11:03:02 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Yaar ab tum sab log decide kar lo....Mere ko  aur JD ko location ka koi issue nahi hai...We're sick of doing the same thing again and again

Pehle NE ke liye Sab logon ke liye feasible flights dekhi...day wise plan kiya....fir wo cancel hua

Ab idhar ke liye waapas time invest kiya same cheez ke liye....

Jo bhi tum log decide karoge....that would be fine....but we won't be planning this trip now
[29/05/19, 11:10:32 AM] Shubham Jamdade: @918439393363 flight ka expense equally divide karte hai sab mai 
Aur abb socch kaha ja sakte 4 days ke liye
[29/05/19, 11:14:07 AM] Navneet: @918439393363 abse think before you speak or plan
[29/05/19, 11:14:35 AM] Navneet: Rahul or JD ne bhut mehnat ki thi be darjeeling wale plan me, 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[29/05/19, 11:15:29 AM] Sparsh Jain: Nice
[29/05/19, 11:21:51 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Chill hai sab 
Decide karo kaha jana hai Aur Flights book karte hai accordingly
[29/05/19, 12:58:28 PM] Hitesh: Mumbai mat karo

North East hi kar lo
[29/05/19, 12:59:00 PM] Hitesh: Abhi bhi kuch nahi bigda hai
[29/05/19, 12:59:51 PM] Hitesh: Flight elevations jyada nahi hai
[29/05/19, 1:01:34 PM] Hitesh: Possible hai
[29/05/19, 1:02:46 PM] Hitesh: Baaki kahi aur change karne ka time nahi hai
[29/05/19, 1:27:37 PM] Hitesh: Ab bht gaand mara li maine
[29/05/19, 1:27:59 PM] Hitesh: Fatafat NE ki kar do
[29/05/19, 1:28:04 PM] Hitesh: Aaj hi sab
[29/05/19, 1:30:22 PM] Hitesh: Wahan ka sab planned hai

Jyada dikkat nahi aayegi

Thoda bhasad kar diya maine

Be matlab pehle hi kar lete toh sahi rehta

Ab thoda sa badh gaya price

Koi dikkat nahi

✌🏻

Jitna bhi upar lagega I will pay
[29/05/19, 1:31:53 PM] Shubham Jamdade: You are coming right ?
[29/05/19, 1:38:54 PM] Shubham Jamdade: Hitesh is not coming
[29/05/19, 1:39:10 PM] Himanshu Singhal: You can consider going to bagha border and all nearby places ...
[29/05/19, 1:39:26 PM] Hitesh: Nahi

[29/05/19, 1:44:56 PM] Hemant: @918439393363  aa raha hai ya nahi?
Agar wo nahi aata hai to Mumbai wala hi karte hain
And tickets aaj hi book karke ye scene khatm karte hain. Ek baar book ho gaya tab kuch change nahi hoga kuch

Jo jo is option ke saath hai, and ja raha hai please do +1,+2 taki aaj khatam karein ye
[29/05/19, 1:46:37 PM] Shubham Jamdade: Hitesh mana kar raha hai 
So aapan option 1 ja rahe hai
[29/05/19, 1:47:20 PM] Shubham Jamdade: This is quite logical and should consider this
[29/05/19, 1:48:00 PM] Shubham Jamdade: +1

[28/08/19, 7:37:06 PM] Abhishek Pathak: I just had a call with a founder of a clean tech startup - Chakr

They have developed a device which retrofits in diesel generators and captures 70-90% of PM emissions, and uses that as a raw material to develop ink.

Founder is 2017 IITD graduate, most of the tech he is using - are derived from the principles of heat exchang n thermodynamics.

He has raised about 28Cr, looks forward to raising 20-25Cr

Sahi m aisa lag rha tha ki aisa Kuch to apan log bbi Kar sakht the.

[07/09/19, 4:21:00 PM] Rakshit Jain: Nayi technology ka wait karne ki zarurat nahi hai, nasa has used missions to bring back complete rovers, which has all the data collected over a period of time. But point yeh hai ki agar crash ho gaya hai toh kya itne crore rupees kharch karna sahi rahega for sending a retrieval mission
[07/09/19, 5:59:29 PM] Pareek: A mission which wont necessarily be just for retrieval
[07/09/19, 6:07:02 PM] Rakshit Jain: The NASA one was just for retrieval though
[07/09/19, 6:07:08 PM] Pareek: Ohkk
[07/09/19, 6:08:05 PM] Sparsh Jain: I think retrieval itself must be requiring enough high technology than to add another mission to it, wouldn't it?

[29/09/19, 11:13:00 PM] Sparsh Jain: Agar Mac hi lena hai, tab pata nahi... But maine Mac use karne walon se burayi hi suni hai...!!! And strong recommendations na lene ki...!!!

[29/09/19, 11:16:39 PM] Rakshit Jain: SSD tab important hoti hai jab you are using a lot of multithreading, jo ki usually gaming ya simulation softwares hi use karte hain, otherwise HDD is fine too....
[29/09/19, 11:17:20 PM] Hemant: Haan utna nahi hai.
Normal personal use ke liye chahiye
In that sense, lene layak hai?

[15/10/19, 4:32:21 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Just spoke to LocalPe, IITR 2017 founders

It's a "Buy online and pay cash" payment gateway option. They tie up with merchants (like Eros, Ixigo etc.), provide an API payment option at the time of checkout and customers can then pay cash at the closest agent/retail outlet (recharge shop, Kirana store etc.).

They are going to launch this product next week in IITR 😍

[15/10/19, 5:46:58 PM] Hitesh: What's the model?

Buy online and then pay cash?

Or recharge your LocalPe account first

Do purchase and pay via API which will ultimately deduct from your LocalPe account?
[15/10/19, 6:19:13 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Buy online n then pay cash
[15/10/19, 7:00:32 PM] Hemant: But wo option to abhi bhi hota hai na?
[15/10/19, 7:00:52 PM] Hemant: I mean har website mein not on some products but majority mein to hota hi hai
[15/10/19, 7:01:10 PM] Navneet: Agree
[15/10/19, 7:01:29 PM] Abhishek Pathak: This is not cod
[15/10/19, 7:01:58 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Buy online n then pay cash to your nearby retail store / kirana shop
[15/10/19, 7:05:11 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Currently most of the purchases/transactions are on cash basis, but there are some services where u need to pay online -- like Netflix, MMT, BookMyShow - they accept digital transactions only.  So a lot of people who dont have such facility - cant avail these services. 

Now they option to get these services and pay in cash the entire amount - to their nearby retail shop (where LocalPe has partnered)

[15/10/19, 7:05:24 PM] Abhishek Pathak: This bro
[15/10/19, 7:06:24 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Imagine a guy in tier 2 - wanting to buy an electronic - at a nearby consumer electronics store he can get it at 20K, but on Snapdeal- its for 15K, but snadeal will only accept online transaction, no COD,
[15/10/19, 7:06:31 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Good enough value prp ?
[15/10/19, 7:06:35 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Prop?
[15/10/19, 7:07:24 PM] Hitesh: What if he do not go to pay?

LocalPe has to set up a team as well for defaulters?
[15/10/19, 7:10:44 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Good point, If you have made the online purchase, till the moment u make the cash payment, the company (Netflix, Snapdeal) keeps that order for hold, because they also know that customers might not necessarily go out n pay,
[15/10/19, 7:10:54 PM] Abhishek Pathak: They have ticked those checks and balances,
[15/10/19, 7:11:20 PM] Hitesh: What is the max time they can hold the payment to LocalPe
[15/10/19, 7:11:29 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Ideally its 24 hours
[15/10/19, 7:11:45 PM] Abhishek Pathak: user gets a prompt to make this payment within 24 hours,
[15/10/19, 7:12:02 PM] Hitesh: And this can be a very great foundation for Harsh's idea

@917999025413 
Take note
[15/10/19, 7:12:15 PM] Abhishek Pathak: but for cases, where amount is slightly high, it can go upt o 2-3 days at max, at the discretion of the company/brand
[15/10/19, 7:12:35 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Ohh yes !

[29/11/19, 4:58:27 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Investors- who are highly educated, who will put their mind to use before taking every decision, who are sitting on shit load of money - still believe in such superstitious stuff
[29/11/19, 5:18:17 PM] Hitesh: Bhai
I support him
[29/11/19, 5:26:50 PM] Pareek: Everyone is. 
Writers. Painters. Poets. Scientists. Presidents. Philosophers. Academicians
[29/11/19, 5:29:05 PM] Harsh Singhal: Me too
[29/11/19, 5:52:33 PM] Sparsh Jain: ‎This message was deleted.
[29/11/19, 5:53:23 PM] Sparsh Jain: To be honest... I too support him, I don't find anything wrong in superstitions if you're still giving your best in your work... Even I do believe in some of them, so can feel him.
[29/11/19, 6:48:42 PM] Abhishek Pathak: The is no harm pushing a date, or feeling fortunate by doing things a certain way.

Where it gets annoying is when you start taking decisions based on these superstitions, like we have seen investors not putting in money even when the business is good but still skeptical because of these superstitions
[29/11/19, 6:49:46 PM] Abhishek Pathak: MATLAB life m har cheez m tum logically sochoge, but you turn a blind eye towards this, that's the point
[29/11/19, 6:50:26 PM] Abhishek Pathak: This was for investors
[29/11/19, 6:58:02 PM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai I might have done the same in some scenarios too 😅😅
[29/11/19, 7:05:23 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Are Lekin you don't intermingle superstitious thoughts with your work.

Like tujhe Kuch code likhna hai, there are two ways, you will choose the one which is more efficient, takes less time to write, runs minimal operations

You will not say ki yeh mere superstitious thoughts k hisaab se Sahi lag rha hai, main to yeh use Karuna
[29/11/19, 7:06:01 PM] Abhishek Pathak: This is exactly what some of the investors do,
[29/11/19, 8:36:57 PM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai
Take a scenario

U have created two models to predict the stock prices

Now with the help of some consulting firm u were able to find out which model is more logical  explainable as compare to other

But when it comes to investing in stocks, u might pick less explainable model because of multiple reasons like u did not had luck with the first one, ..
[29/11/19, 8:43:06 PM] Abhishek Pathak: So I expect investors be rational in their decision making, that's it
[29/11/19, 8:44:12 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Kyunni Karne ko to phir koi Kuch BHI Kar sakhta, the decision making process has to be logical
[29/11/19, 8:50:53 PM] Navneet: Oh bhai
[29/11/19, 8:51:25 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Tera internet connection ab aaya hai kya  😂😂
[29/11/19, 8:55:48 PM] Pareek: You don't intermingle it with your work. True.

But it's like HR. It's there to make you feel happier while going about ur core business.
[29/11/19, 8:56:40 PM] Abhishek Pathak: 😂😂
[29/11/19, 8:59:28 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Its like HR has to decide between 2 candidates, and she/he chooses one over the other, not because of high skill/talent but because of some superstition, to us rejected candidate ko to gussa hi aayega, kyunki use reject karne ka koi valid reason nhi hua, 

Thats how it feels jab ham investor ke paas koi company lek jate hain and woh aise chutiya reasons ki wajah se mana kar deta hai
[29/11/19, 9:20:03 PM] Pareek: But then the candidate knows that nothing is fair after all. Ouch!😅
[29/11/19, 9:20:28 PM] Pareek: I feel the pinch.
[29/11/19, 9:43:46 PM] Abhishek Pathak: 😂😂, Generally aise nhi hota hai investor- startups ke beech mein, most of the decision making - either to dig deep/invest/pass is based on some rationale/logic

Plus HR bakwaas person hire karega, to overall company ka loss hoga, directly koi HR ka kuch major loss nhi hai, so he has the liberty to incorporate that superstitious behaviour during candidate selection, but investor ki to daal roti isi pe based hai, so ideally he shouldn't do this, but haan ab kisi ko chutiyap karne se rokk to nhi hi sakhte hain ham

[06/12/19, 12:35:27 PM] Nishant: Sorta..I don't know for sure if it's a fake encounter or a true one but delivering justice in such a way without a trial is definitely not a true democracy..
Delivering quick justice is good but I am afraid that this would be an encouragement to several fake encounter cases
[06/12/19, 12:51:00 PM] Himanshu Singhal: It is Democracy( if they have followed the rules). 

But the way it is done raise the suspicion.
[06/12/19, 1:01:59 PM] Hemant: Yes but in the first place, wo rape scene ko recreate karana hi kyu chah rahi thi wo bhi exact same spot?
And kisi reason se kara bhi rahi thi to chaaron ke chaaron ne police se gun cheen liya?
Agar ek ne cheena Hota to usko maarte na, baaki nihatthe hote to unko pakad lete.

Maybe questions isiliye nahi uth rahe abhi kyuki wo IPS jiske under sab hua hai uska history hai aise encounters karne ka(warangal 3 acid attack victims)

[06/12/19, 7:27:26 PM] Rakshit Jain: Not at all suspicious.... Obviously it’s a fake encounter.... Scene recreate bhi karna tha toh raat mein hi karna tha? Raat ke 3 baje kaun chutiyape karne nikalta hai..... Pata chalega baaki, I’m pretty sure it’s fake, but whatever.... If the judicial system doesn’t work, people will have to stoop to vigilantism

Iss tareeke se marne me

Uski gaand me dum tha usme maar diya

Next wale ke liye example kahan set hua

Ab next banda ye karne se pehle itna nahi darega

Matlab court se milta order strict ki maar do

Toh lagta haan ki judicial system is strict all over the country

Plus koi halka bhi politically powerful banda hota toh aisa encounter nahi hi hota

That girl is watching big boss, I also watch BB but am not up to date, don't know if I should strike a conversation, last time kaafi khrab experience tha
[15/02/20, 8:15:16 PM] Nishant: Kya hogaya hai..achanak se itna despo kab se ho gya tu🤣🤣

[15/02/20, 8:18:30 PM] Hitesh: You only go fishing when you are hungry (unless it is your hobby 😉)

And far as I know
He is not hungry anymore
[15/02/20, 8:20:06 PM] Harsh Singhal: Bhaiyo what I have learnt till now
Able to strike a conversation with a random person is a good skill to have in ur bucket
[15/02/20, 8:22:00 PM] Hitesh: So that skill should be there with gender neutrality
🤪
We never saw a message
"Bhaiyo there is a cool guy besides me in OLA, suggest me some points to initiate a conversation"
😆😅😉
[15/02/20, 8:24:11 PM] Harsh Singhal: Yes correct
When u try to learn something new
U need some motivation
[15/02/20, 8:25:20 PM] Hitesh: Anyway, having said the above

One bad experience shouldn't limit you to experience the potential of beautiful conversation

Just strike the convo buddy

[15/03/20, 4:42:23 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Girl: Tell me a secret that you haven't shared with anyone😁

Navneet: Umm ...okay, You know I keep bragging among my friends that I do boom boom a lot and that I m really a pro at it 😒

Girl: But ?

Navneet: But the reality is that not even a single girl/boy (yeah I tried both ways 🙃) finds me attractive, let alone get intimate with me 😢

Girl: Koi nhi yaar, everyone eventually finds the right person☺

Navneet: You know I have a guy friend who is straight and in a relationship, he got a proposal by another boy sometime back

I made fun of him, but on the inside, I felt envious, I wish someone had done the same for me, atleast I would got some validation 😕

Girl: don't feel that way, be positive, you will find someone and eventually will get laid 😇

Navneet: Oh no, there's another thing, I had a sexual encounter with someone once..this girl, she had a thing for dickheads, just like me 😅

Girl: So you had sex 🤩

Navneet: Umm...well not technically, actually it was my first time so...unfortunately I was done within a few minutes in the foreplay itself 😅.

Girl: that must have been embarrassing 

Navneet: Yeah, I made her upset..but I tried to make up by getting her arousesd, turned out, I sucked at that too... cause I never paid attention to this part while watching porn 😣

Girl: So then it was over ?

Navneet: Umm..not completely, she dressed up, took her stuff and left my place, but then came back after 2 minutes, only to tell me that I would never get laid and I got a small dick too 😠

Girl: holy fuck, that was too much.

Navneet: haa yaar, bhale hi Kisi ka chota h to kya hua, aise Kisi ko bolna thodi chahiye, self esteem toot jata h ekdum

So that....that was my deepest darkest secret. What about you.

Girl: well, I have also said the same thing to a lot of dickheads who bother me.

Navneet: No way, you can't say this

Girl: Are sacchi this is my truth

[20/03/20, 9:05:07 PM] Hitesh: Koi sunlo aur summarize kar do bhai
[20/03/20, 9:05:13 PM] Pareek: I also heard it. Pata nahi yr kitna sach hai
[20/03/20, 9:05:30 PM] Pareek: Basically it says 15 apr to 15 june India on lockdown
[20/03/20, 9:05:37 PM] Pareek: Kuch bhi nahi khulega
[20/03/20, 9:05:53 PM] Nishant: Will it be a wise idea to go home now?
[20/03/20, 9:06:00 PM] Pareek: It says Udaipur me bhi suspicious log mile hain
[20/03/20, 9:06:14 PM] Nishant: Mere flat me ki nahi rahega yaar😅..all alone for 2 months
[20/03/20, 9:06:22 PM] Pareek: Jabki i have not been able to verify it thru secondary sources
[20/03/20, 9:07:06 PM] Pareek: Modi has yesterday said not to stock food or necessary items.
[20/03/20, 9:07:19 PM] Pareek: I highly doubt if a lockdown situation will occur
[20/03/20, 9:07:54 PM] Nishant: Haan but a trial for lockdown: junta curfew
[20/03/20, 9:08:03 PM] Nishant: Both possibilities are true
[20/03/20, 9:08:21 PM] Pareek: Yr junta curfew ka ek aur reason hai
[20/03/20, 9:08:37 PM] Pareek: America me do din me cases 5000 se 10000 pahuch gaye
[20/03/20, 9:09:04 PM] Pareek: And possible primary reason is being stated as socializing on holiday
[20/03/20, 9:09:56 PM] Nishant: Haan agreed
[20/03/20, 9:13:50 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: And moreover Junta curfew mein essential services are open....ismein to bola hai ki Hospital aur Police station hi khulenge
[20/03/20, 9:14:09 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: 2 maheene log survive kaise karenge....
[20/03/20, 9:14:27 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: Unlikely lag raha hai yaar ye to
[20/03/20, 9:14:56 PM] Pareek: Vahi
[20/03/20, 9:15:21 PM] Pareek: Especially in India where there r so many at the bottom of pyramid and there is no relief budget announced for the same
[20/03/20, 9:16:01 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: Point
[20/03/20, 9:29:13 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Correct
[20/03/20, 9:33:08 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Don't panic, stay where you are.  For pre-caution keep stocks for medicine and essential items only ( aata and daal ) .
[20/03/20, 9:35:27 PM] Rakshit Jain: Atleast toilet paper toh hoard nahi karega koi vahan pe🙄🙄🙄🙄
[20/03/20, 9:36:06 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Hum paani walen hain 😅
[20/03/20, 9:37:59 PM] Hitesh: Haan yaar ye log toilet paper kyun stock kar rahe?

Is there a rumour ki there would be no supply of toilet paper?
[20/03/20, 9:38:19 PM] Pareek: Hehe
[20/03/20, 9:38:29 PM] Pareek: Logo ko sensational chahiye kuch bhi
[20/03/20, 9:38:58 PM] Pareek: Udaipur me bhi sabzi aur kirana ki shops pe alag bheed hai
[20/03/20, 9:39:05 PM] Pareek: 🤦‍♂️
[20/03/20, 9:39:53 PM] Navneet: @919521649652 bhai bhilwara bhut risky hai abhi....poora lockdown hai....police entry ni krne de rhi kisi ko
[20/03/20, 9:40:12 PM] Hitesh: Sabzi?
🤨

I don't think one should stock sabji

Woh toh daily basis pe jab tak lockdown ghoshit nahi hota
[20/03/20, 9:40:35 PM] Pareek: Tera mavli aur udaipur me bhi to ghr hai
[20/03/20, 9:40:37 PM] Pareek: Nai?
[20/03/20, 9:40:49 PM] Navneet: Mera ghr ni h

[20/03/20, 9:41:07 PM] Pareek: Logo ko lag raha achanak lockdown declare hoga, pehle hi kar lo
[20/03/20, 9:41:33 PM] Navneet: Ek rasta or hai bhl me jane ka....vaha se jaau kya😢
[20/03/20, 9:41:33 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Nhi yaar ...nhi kar sakte aisa... Bhookhe mar jaayenge log
[20/03/20, 9:41:39 PM] Pareek: Okkay. Tera residence hai vaha ka....quarantine ka bol sakte hain bas. Kar liyo khud ko quarantine ghr me
[20/03/20, 9:41:51 PM] Pareek: Exactly. Main to yahi keh raha hu
[20/03/20, 9:42:06 PM] Pareek: Middle class can afford to stock....lower class kya karega
[20/03/20, 9:42:31 PM] Navneet: Bhl 5 hrs ke liye sbjimandi & kirana store khulegi roj bss....baaki koi v shop nahi khulega
[20/03/20, 9:42:38 PM] Hitesh: I am thoroughly following the Wuhan lockdown
And it proves ki logon ko bhooka nahi marne diya jayega...

Don't worry...
[20/03/20, 9:43:07 PM] Pareek: Waah....following Wuhan lockdown. Gajab
[20/03/20, 9:44:08 PM] Hitesh: There are people broadcasting daily from inside

There is one American, Meghan Monroe

She is telling how it is to be in lockdown in Wuhan
[20/03/20, 9:44:44 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Bhai yahan gov ka public distribution system hone ke baad bhi hunger death hoti h... 

Tujhe lgta h Wuhan jaise   implement kar paayenge yahan pr.
[20/03/20, 9:45:35 PM] Himanshu Singhal: I am pretty sure that it won't reach to Wuhan or Italy level. Although kuch dino ka lock down ho sakta h
[20/03/20, 9:48:52 PM] Hitesh: Bhai....

We are lucky to be in India

In countries like America, where medical cost is staggering
Let alone the $3380 corona test fees

Many states in India on the other hand are treating it for free and have evem announced a Bhatta of 4 lakh if casualty
[20/03/20, 9:50:18 PM] Hitesh: A country where sikh community will not let anyone sleep hungry

We are not going to die of hunger in a lockdown for sure
[20/03/20, 9:51:55 PM] Hitesh: We Indians are stupid sometimes but we are the one who have flourished if the situation is dire...

Please na travel karo na travel ko promote karo
Abhi sabne ghar jaana start kar diya hai 
But agar aissa hua ek do din aur, it will lead to spread of corona even in small cities
And then it would be impossible for ur govt to stop it
Stay wherever u are. Please.
Thode problem face karlo sab.

Aur agar kisse ko lagta hai ki nhi hoga then please read Italy story

[22/03/20, 1:01:42 AM] Abhishek Pathak: *Inputs required*

Yoo boys,

Yaar main Harsh and Hitesh Kuch time se startup ideas p discussion Kar rhe hai, almost 4-5 sectors + 8-10 ideas brainstorm karne ke baad, ham log ek specific idea pe narrow down hue hain

Abbi Kuch time se, ham log ek Indian snack brand develop Karne Ka soch rhe hai, genesis being ki sabhi ko ache snacks ki craving hoti hai, but options for good quality and hygienic snacks are quite limited, so we want to be the go to place for anyone to get high quality, fibrous, low oil/fat and healthy snacks, this is how we want to position ourselves.

Kaafi brainstorm Karne k baad, we feel this is something worth pursuing for.  Abhi atleast saal Bhar to remotely hi kaam karenge, till we develop a strong brand, then once it reaches a certain scale, tab may be full time soche.

Ham abhi 3 hi hain, would be super great agar baaki koi bhi member interesting hai n join karna chahta, ya even apne inputs dena chahta hai. 

Yaar main to almost weekly hi dekhta rhta hu ki college friends saath m startup shuru Kar rhe hai, n doosro ki funding karate karate hamesha yahi socha ki ham bbi kuch start kare, experience kare startup build Karna kaisa hota hai, I know ham sab saath m shuru karenge to kaam to hoga hi but maza bahot aayega :)
‎[22/03/20, 1:08:46 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: ‎video omitted
[22/03/20, 1:08:51 AM] Rakshit Jain: Elaborate on the idea pls
[22/03/20, 1:12:02 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Ye baked snacks type kuch bol raha hai kya
[22/03/20, 1:14:14 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Ideally, we want to develop a multi snack restaurant brand, eg Chaayos (for tea), Starbucks (for coffee), Samosa Singh (for samosa)
[22/03/20, 1:16:16 AM] Rakshit Jain: Naa naa, not this, I meant ki explain what would the manufacturing process for the snacks be, so that it is different from other snacks? Dukaan types kholne ka socha hai ya Packed goods like haldi rams?
[22/03/20, 1:17:38 AM] Nishant: Haan..same doubt
[22/03/20, 1:20:21 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Packaged food nhi hai atleast starting ke liye to, so dont confuse it with the likes of Sattviko
[22/03/20, 1:32:17 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Badhiya guys 🙏🙏
I really liked the idea 👍👍
[22/03/20, 1:33:08 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Snacks you mean 
Samosa and chat and all right ?
[22/03/20, 1:33:53 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Cool.cool.
Abhi dekhe message
[22/03/20, 1:34:14 AM] Abhishek Pathak: So we want to deliver multi varieties of different snacks from different regions of India with greater emphasis on hygience, delivery packaging and want to build up a strong offline brand down the line
[22/03/20, 1:41:06 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Haan, samosa, pani puri, chat types hi, but mostly logon ko limited yahi pta hai, our thought would be to expand the food portfolio to other snacks - not just Pan India based but bahar ke countries k bhi
[22/03/20, 1:42:52 AM] Shubham Jamdade: So what I think when I was in bangalore I used to look for samosa and kachoor or for ex. Bhel paanipuri kind of thing 
There were local good shops 
But i think you guys are trying to develop brand like starbucks 
Which will have not all.chats but famous one 
From customer perspective I would prefer buying from your brand for snacks bz of hygiene and service rather than local one 
But dont keep prices very high
There is Joshi vadewale chain in pune
But there is no paratha thing in maharashtra which I feel should be there. If your brand or company is providing that then that will.be good 
Its difficult to write all my thoughts here 😅😅
[22/03/20, 1:50:51 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Haan shuru probably kuch limited snacks se hi hoga, once we have cracked the taste, we will expand to other snack types, but yes with greater emphasis on one of them (as you mentioned Starbucks for coffee), cause we cant be best at offering every snack, we need to be pro in atleast 1 category and in addition offer other categories as well to serve the palette of in general consumer.
[22/03/20, 1:50:54 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Haan hygiene pe extra focus rhega, kyunki ham logon ne bhi yahi feel kara ki healthy snack options nhi hai atleast Bangalore mein to, price yaar medium types hi rkhenge, starbucks jitna to nhi hi obviously, somewhere between 50-100 per snack item, probably 100+ rkhe if we want to be a premium food chain, but those things are yet to be finalised
[22/03/20, 1:53:03 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Good good 👍
‎[22/03/20, 8:35:10 AM] Hemant: ‎image omitted
[22/03/20, 8:50:18 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Would it be similar to Imly ?
‎[22/03/20, 10:24:27 AM] Hitesh: ‎video omitted
[22/03/20, 10:35:38 AM] Nishant: Not sure if we would be able to develop it fully but one thing..at least we can submit this in https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/
[22/03/20, 10:36:41 AM] Nishant: The reason I am saying that..even if we are not able to develop..the government might get a hang of it (in case the idea might not have occured to them)
[22/03/20, 10:36:54 AM] Nishant: And get it developed
[22/03/20, 10:37:26 AM] Nishant: However..said that this is very unlikely to be implemented in india because of the nature of democratic system
[22/03/20, 10:38:34 AM] Nishant: This will be touted and seen as a n infringement of the right to personal freedom and privacy and the government might be accused of *spying*...
[22/03/20, 10:38:42 AM] Nishant: But still a very great idea
[22/03/20, 10:48:59 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Idea to kaafi acchha hai
[22/03/20, 10:49:20 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: True
‎[22/03/20, 10:50:57 AM] Hitesh: ‎video omitted
[22/03/20, 10:52:38 AM] Navneet: Idea is good
[22/03/20, 10:54:06 AM] Harsh Singhal: Nice initiative!!
But few things, I would add

1. Architecture will not be straight forward (it will be complexed)
2. Huge cloud storage is needed
3. For this app to work, everyone will have to allow location sharing.
App should be hack proof.
[22/03/20, 10:55:15 AM] Nishant: Storage won't be an issue...govt  will have the infrastructure for that...or somehow they will managae..for now if required we can use iitr mail id for trail
[22/03/20, 10:56:11 AM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai do you really thiy mail id would work for thia
[22/03/20, 10:56:34 AM] Harsh Singhal: U are storing every minute data for each person
[22/03/20, 10:56:55 AM] Nishant: Bhai iitr mail id par unlimited storage hai Google drive par
[22/03/20, 10:57:15 AM] Harsh Singhal: 👍🏻
[22/03/20, 10:57:59 AM] Nishant: And we would only be developing a prototype  which will be scaled by government
[22/03/20, 10:58:29 AM] Nishant: Seperately aadhar can be used for identification purposes as 90 percent junta has that
[22/03/20, 10:58:47 AM] Navneet: 👍
[22/03/20, 10:59:35 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: Yeah
[22/03/20, 11:00:30 AM] Hitesh: I talked with a developer

It is not a complex app
A full fledged developer can develop it in no time
[22/03/20, 11:01:06 AM] Harsh Singhal: I am 100% sure it is not that direct
[22/03/20, 11:01:45 AM] Nishant: Bata himanshu🤪
[22/03/20, 11:01:53 AM] Nishant: The nation wants to know
[22/03/20, 11:02:02 AM] Nishant: I feel same
[22/03/20, 11:02:29 AM] Harsh Singhal: But haa Govt will help u in future for sure
[22/03/20, 11:03:03 AM] Pareek: The idea is great. For sure
[22/03/20, 11:03:12 AM] Pareek: I get it completely. The idea
[22/03/20, 11:03:39 AM] Pareek: But even after that, it is real time tracking of all the people
[22/03/20, 11:04:07 AM] Pareek: Even Google maps can needs some tweaking and it can be made, although anti-trust issues will come or whatever
[22/03/20, 11:04:41 AM] Harsh Singhal: Yup correct
Google maps already has this feature
[22/03/20, 11:05:07 AM] Nishant: Yeah like cab tracking api
[22/03/20, 11:05:17 AM] Harsh Singhal: I think, Google must have started making such app
[22/03/20, 11:05:37 AM] Nishant: *api : feature
[22/03/20, 11:06:08 AM] Hitesh: People

No live tracking

If a case is positive
Only then we will look into the log ki kiske contact me aaya
[22/03/20, 11:06:19 AM] Hitesh: Doesn't mean we shouldn't
[22/03/20, 11:06:34 AM] Harsh Singhal: Correct!!
[22/03/20, 11:06:41 AM] Hitesh: There are developers started on the same track in Singapore
[22/03/20, 11:07:03 AM] Pareek: Ok. Gotcha
[22/03/20, 11:07:17 AM] Pareek: Kaafi sahi
[22/03/20, 11:07:52 AM] Pareek: But i dont know if there is hardware for the same
[22/03/20, 11:09:14 AM] Hitesh: See the thing is the only thing against this we have is slow down the spread
As no viable vaccine/cure for now

Aise me we can't afford undetected cases

Kapoor the singer ke case me 400 suspicious..

I am sure it is just a rough estimate

Woh 400 log aage kinse mile kab tak manual tracking and samne wale ki memory recalling capabilities pe rely karenge...
[22/03/20, 11:15:08 AM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai
I think both are same
[22/03/20, 11:16:16 AM] Hitesh: That would be an issue

Kyunki location se 4 ft jitna precise ja payenge?

We can use WiFi or bluetooth to enter a log but again

Malware injection issues and WiFi bluetooth always on rakhna
😣
[22/03/20, 11:17:54 AM] Harsh Singhal: Uske Api hai ek
[22/03/20, 11:18:15 AM] Harsh Singhal: Used by bounce and many other apps
[22/03/20, 11:18:33 AM] Hitesh: Kya kare?
[22/03/20, 11:18:38 AM] Hitesh: Pitch kare?
[22/03/20, 11:18:54 AM] Harsh Singhal: Haa bhai
Pitch to kar he
[22/03/20, 12:55:40 PM] Sparsh Jain: Idea acha hai👍🏻
[22/03/20, 12:56:29 PM] Sparsh Jain: But location on chahiye hogi humesha... Woh feature shayad app mein aa jayega, ki background mein work kare aur location on rakhe
[22/03/20, 12:57:12 PM] Sparsh Jain: Aur privacy ke liye, har mobile ka ek unique number ban sakta hai, like IMEI, jo backend par integrated ho personal data se
[22/03/20, 12:58:04 PM] Hitesh: We call it an encryption key whatsapp also use that

Nice
[22/03/20, 12:58:21 PM] Sparsh Jain: Taki person positive ho toh uska mobile bhi positive declare ho jaye, i think yehi idea hai!!
[22/03/20, 1:02:31 PM] Sparsh Jain: Kuch kuch karke agar yeh mobile number se integrate hota hai, toh log back history bhi daal sakte hain voluntarily... Jisse jo principal database hai usmein connections ban jayein, aur individual ki app par woh encryption keys display ho
[22/03/20, 5:33:32 PM] Shubham Jamdade: Nice idea

Abhi itne log aa rahe hain testing ke liye ki the facilities are already fully in use. Iske liye ek slowdown chahiye hoga biich mein, in which thw govt can start its own initiative

[23/03/20, 9:42:11 PM] Rakshit Jain: This article clearly says that it is not sure that it is the cure. It has been helpful for a non-randomised trial of 24 people, which does not ensure that it is a cure. It is an antimalaria drug which can be harmful if taken in the wrong dosage or without doctor's approval
[23/03/20, 9:42:15 PM] Rakshit Jain: At a Thursday news briefing, Trump trumpeted that chloroquine had shown “very, very encouraging early results” and said “we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.” Minutes later, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, an oncologist, clarified that the drug would be available “in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and — asked and answered.”

Friday, the President said, “It may work, it may not work. I feel good about it. That’s all it is. Just a feeling.” At the same press conference, Anthony Fauci, a physician who heads the NIAID and a veteran of outbreaks going back to HIV, emphasized the need for a methodical clinical trial.
[23/03/20, 9:42:48 PM] Rakshit Jain: And here, I meant trump, not hitesh
[23/03/20, 9:43:28 PM] Rakshit Jain: If anyone wants to follow what US is doing, just listen to anthony fauci, not trump. He is the lead doctor (written above) incharge of covid cases
[23/03/20, 9:46:14 PM] Rakshit Jain: https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5482/hydroxychloroquine-oral/details

Side effects of hydroxychloroquine, and that of chloroquine are even much severe, so please be careful.
[23/03/20, 9:47:07 PM] Abhishek Pathak: What was the source for this Hitesh,

This is a WHO link, please read the hydroxychloroquine data
[23/03/20, 9:47:39 PM] Rakshit Jain: Usually inshorts is reliable, but I think they are jumping the gun in this case (ICMR)

[23/03/20, 11:04:01 PM] Rahul Shrivastava: Nicely clarified 👍🏻
[24/03/20, 9:20:27 AM] Nishant: The combination of drugs for which WHO is allowing the global trials was tested days back in SMS (Sawai Man Singh) Hospital Jaipur and they were able to treat 2 cases of 3 afaik...and that doctor had said chloroquine reduces lung contraction and that is the reason they were using those drugs...and taking drugs like these on our own without assesing side impacts is definitely dangerous
[24/03/20, 9:23:03 AM] Nishant: Looks promising for air pollution and not sure about corona though

[24/03/20, 5:04:31 PM] Nishant: WELL PLAYED CHINA....

SCENE 1 : The curtain opens: China becomes ill, enters a "crisis" and paralyzes its trade.  The curtain closes.

 SCENE II.  The curtain opens: The Chinese currency is devalued.  They do not do anything.  The curtain closes.

SCENE III.  The curtain opens:: Due to the lack of trade of companies from Europe and the USA that are based in China, their shares fall 40% of their value.

 SCENE IV.  The curtain opens:: The world is ill, China buys 30% of the shares of companies in Europe and the US at a very low price.  The curtain closes.

 SCENE V. The curtain opens: China has controlled the disease and owns companies in Europe and the US.  And he decides that these companies stay in China and earn $ 20,000Billions.  The curtain closes.  How is the play called?

SCENE  VI: Checkmate!

 ReAmazing but true

 Two videos have passed between yesterday and today that convinced me of something I suspected, but had no basis.  It was just my speculation.  Now I am convinced that the coronavirus was purposely propagated by the Chinese themselves.
 At first they were too prepared.  Three weeks after the start of the roll, 14 days and a 12,000-bed hospitals were already under construction.  And they really built them in two weeks.  Awesome.
 Yesterday they announced that they had stopped the epidemic.  They appear in videos celebrating, they announce that they even have a vaccine.  How could they create it so quickly without having all the genetic information?  Well if you are the owner of the formula it is not difficult at all.
 And today I just saw a video that explains how Den Xiao Ping gave the west a half stick.  Due to the coronavirus, the actions of Western companies in China fell dramatically.  China I just hope, when they went down enough they bought them.  Now the companies,
 Created by the USA and Europe in China with all the technology put in by these exchanges and their capital they passed into the hands of China, which is now rising with all that technological potential and will be able to set prices at will to sell everything they need to the West.  How are you?
 None of this could have happened by chance.  China who cared that a few old men died?  Fewer old-age pensions to pay, but the loot has been huge.  And right now the West is financially defeated, in crisis and stunned by the disease.  And without knowing what to do.
 Masterfully diabolic.  It had to be the communists.  |

Adding to this, they are now the single largest owners of US treasury with 1.18 trillion holding surpassing Japan. 
An instrument that has seen the most rally

One ☝ prospective & Analogy
-------_--------------_-------////-//////
 How come Russia & North Korea have Low or Zero incidence of Covid- 19 ? 

Is it because they are staunch allies of China

On the other hand USA / South Korea / United Kingdom / France / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit

How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus? 

China says that the drastic initial measures that they took were very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas

Why Beijing was not hit ? Why only Wuhan? 

It is interesting to ponder upon.. right ? 

Well ..Wuhan is open for business now

Covid - 19 needs to be seen in the backdrop of the arm twisting of China by USA in the trade war

America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially 

Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China. 

China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present THE MOST POWERFUL country in the world. 

So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. 

I am sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this.... to topple Trump.... 

Lately President Trump  has always been telling of how the GREAT American economy was improving on all fronts and jobs were coming back to the USA

The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an ECONOMIC HAVOC. 

Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump through impeachment.....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus.

Wuhan's epidemic was a showcase. 

At the peak of the virus epidemic....China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas. 

As President he should have been covered from head to toe.....but that was not the case.

He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was already in place before the virus was released

China's vision is to control the World ECONOMY by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.....Later China will announce that their Medical Researchers have found a cure to destroy the virus

Now China shall OWN  the stocks of All Western Alliances and these countries will soon be slave to their NEW MASTER..... CHINA

[25/03/20, 1:58:53 PM] Harsh Singhal: A simple question:
What are the measures govt can take so to make people follow lockdown??
[25/03/20, 1:59:15 PM] Nishant: Curfew
[25/03/20, 1:59:34 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Shoot at sight 😜
[25/03/20, 1:59:41 PM] Nishant: But to maintain peace...maintain food supplies somehow

[25/03/20, 2:07:56 PM] Navneet: Ha
[25/03/20, 2:11:57 PM] Harsh Singhal: I think these measures can help govt:
1. Decreasing the number of advertisements over television
2. Free Netflix account for all citizens
3. Tying wild animals at various corners
4. Heavy fine (if they are roaming without any reason) and use the amount collected for treatment
5. Shoot at sight 😛
[25/03/20, 2:14:15 PM] Harsh Singhal: 6. IPL matches in empty stadiums

[26/03/20, 10:53:56 PM] Harsh Singhal: Yup, completely agree
But doctors generally wear full body protection cover
And first class might not be that congested

[26/03/20, 11:25:23 PM] Nishant: But thoda modifications ke saath it can definitely work
[26/03/20, 11:25:25 PM] Nishant: 🙂
[26/03/20, 11:26:35 PM] Harsh Singhal: I also thought about this
But it will also help because virus is airborne
[26/03/20, 11:27:24 PM] Nishant: Airborne hai toh help kaise karega ?😅
[26/03/20, 11:27:29 PM] Sparsh Jain: It's not airborne i think, it settles on surfaces
[26/03/20, 11:27:51 PM] Nishant: Who clarify ki thi ki it might be airborne too
[26/03/20, 11:28:15 PM] Harsh Singhal: Agar window open rahege to outsiders ko problem ho sakte hai
[26/03/20, 11:29:27 PM] Sparsh Jain: Okay, website par dekha tha maine toh aisa kuch likha tha it can be but it's not how it majorly spreads
[26/03/20, 11:37:56 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, it can survive in air for a couple of hours, but it is not airborne. Airborne viruses transmit majorly through air. But covid spreads through contact. So, not airborne
[26/03/20, 11:38:14 PM] Rakshit Jain: But yeah, it might be complicated to use a train coach
[26/03/20, 11:44:45 PM] Hitesh: It needs respiratory droplets (especially cough) to transmit

As long as the droplet remains, airborne it may enter any living body.
[26/03/20, 11:50:44 PM] Rakshit Jain: For a couple hours. But airborne ki definition dekhega toh it's not an airborne virus
[27/03/20, 12:04:27 AM] Harsh Singhal: Cool
Ek baat aur batao
Can it spread through water?

[27/03/20, 1:23:19 PM] Himanshu Singhal: So if it is all planned then it clearly indicates that people who are equipped with these types of tech,  are having capability to stop the whole world from development. In a indirect way, they are controlling the world economy.
[27/03/20, 1:24:37 PM] Himanshu Singhal: And we can see that China is back on economic foot. So now whole world is suffering and in this time they going to boost their economy. 

In a nutshell it is all about money.

[31/03/20, 8:25:12 PM] Himanshu Singhal: Hi All, 

This time ,I see we are donating for covid-19. I don't know how many institutions are having this facility but in PayPal ,  for every donation an employee does , paypal donate the 2 times of it. I mean if I am donating x rupees and then paypal will donate 2x rupees for same cause from their side. And there is no limit on the donation.

So if some one want to use it, let me know. There might be some conditions ( I am still figuring that out).

This has a feature ki I can pay some 10-20-50 Rs to get a bday/any wish/message from a selected influencer who is there on the platform, and he /she will get paid to develop a video message for me.

Matlab Paisa bbi main du, creator bhi main hi select karu, and message ka context bhi main hi du, n then uske message ka wait karu, and phir message dekhke Khush ho jau

I was thinking ki PSU recruitments ka kya hoga?

Tried contacting recruitment team

They said they are also baffled... Except they know there is going to be a delay for sure

So, in my view

-delay, for sure
-online interview(skype)(but as a last resort, that too only for ONGC, for others, how will they conduct GD, GT?)
-one batch is going to take hit, vacancy wise, either Gate 2020/2021 batch because of the delay
-IOC aspirants will be at loss, as they heavily recruit from campus, they won't take the headache for recruiting from GATE
[16/04/20, 12:47:02 PM] Hitesh: Aur koi points/prediction from your side?
[16/04/20, 12:47:06 PM] Hitesh: Do comment

[19/04/20, 8:22:42 PM] Hitesh: 🔷 *A Brain Teaser*

_Can be solved with logic_....

Steve is taking a bus to Central Park. Steve tells Alice the hour of his bus departure and he tells Annie at which minute it leaves. He also tells them both that the bus leaves between 0600 and 1000.

Alice & Annie consult the timetable and find the following services between those two time: 0632 0643 0650 0717 0746 0819 0832 0917 0919 0950.

Alice then says “I don’t know when Steve’s bus leaves but I am sure that neither does Annie”

Annie Replies “I didn’t know his bus, but now i do”

Alice responds “Now I do as well!”

When is Steve’s bus?
[19/04/20, 8:24:16 PM] ‎Nishant changed the subject to “13 Primes🤟🏻”
[19/04/20, 8:26:31 PM] Navneet: 0832

[21/04/20, 12:53:24 AM] Navneet: & Upstream companies will have big koss
[21/04/20, 12:53:26 AM] Navneet: loss*
[21/04/20, 12:54:11 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Yes
[21/04/20, 1:01:53 AM] Rahul Shrivastava: 😮😮
[21/04/20, 1:02:50 AM] Harsh Singhal: How??
[21/04/20, 1:03:09 AM] Nishant: Exactly
[21/04/20, 1:03:11 AM] Nishant: ?

[21/04/20, 1:04:23 AM] Nishant: Fuck man
[21/04/20, 1:05:20 AM] Navneet: 6k people fired from oil industries in a single day
[21/04/20, 1:05:28 AM] Nishant: Aur price negative kaise ho sakta hai ?
[21/04/20, 1:05:37 AM] Shubham Jamdade: Those who are integrated downstream and upstream 
But yeah I understand the refined oil price might be reduced 
But drop in crude oil price is huge
[21/04/20, 1:05:39 AM] Navneet: No storage
[21/04/20, 1:05:46 AM] Nishant: Chill reh...kuch nahi hoga
[21/04/20, 1:06:06 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Is this why they asked to write that test, are they re-evaluating their people ?
[21/04/20, 1:06:23 AM] Abhishek Pathak: Matlab tu woh test de rha tha, us context mein poocha maine
[21/04/20, 1:07:26 AM] Navneet: Those tests are just usual tests....Needs to be  >95% of all the time & specific tests for promotion..just this...
No connection with firing
[21/04/20, 1:08:09 AM] Nishant: This explains profit for refineries then
[21/04/20, 1:08:26 AM] Abhishek Pathak: > 95% is too much to ask,
[21/04/20, 1:08:28 AM] Shubham Jamdade: No its other way 
Those who are integrated will be at loss 
Only refineries might at large profit 
Because raw material price is reduced
[21/04/20, 1:10:01 AM] Navneet: Not a big deal.....unlimited attempts available for every tests...total no.of  passed tests should be >95%
[21/04/20, 1:10:20 AM] Navneet: Test*
[21/04/20, 1:10:29 AM] Nishant: Like Coursera course quizzes
[21/04/20, 1:10:38 AM] Navneet: No idea abt thus

[22/04/20, 3:06:50 PM] Abhishek Pathak: IITR founders, we helped them raise some $20 Mn in 2018, they have started voluntary exits by offering 2-3 month salary
[22/04/20, 3:07:19 PM] Navneet: Voluntary hai
[22/04/20, 3:07:38 PM] Navneet: khud se fire nahi kr skti h koi v compant mtllbb during this lockdown?
[22/04/20, 3:07:49 PM] Hitesh: Don't be happy
[22/04/20, 3:08:46 PM] Navneet: ?
[22/04/20, 3:09:07 PM] Hitesh: 🤷🏻‍♂
[22/04/20, 3:10:50 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Like if they drop some x% of employees, they should be able to sustain this period, now best way to do this is to roll down voluntary exits, 

If they dont meet x% target, then they may start forced exits,
[22/04/20, 3:12:06 PM] Hitesh: Why would someone take a voluntary exit?
[22/04/20, 3:12:39 PM] Abhishek Pathak: I dont know bro,
[22/04/20, 3:12:41 PM] Navneet: If they getting some incentives
[22/04/20, 3:12:56 PM] Navneet: wrna company fire kregi to

[22/04/20, 3:17:50 PM] Harsh Singhal: I think Yes (not sure)
They can
[22/04/20, 3:18:21 PM] Harsh Singhal: Govt has asked them not imposed
[22/04/20, 3:19:04 PM] Hitesh: Yes
Mene bhi yahi suna tha

they have urged corporates not to
But
No such guidelines
[22/04/20, 3:19:18 PM] Harsh Singhal: Most probably Reliance will hire now in good quantity
[22/04/20, 3:28:57 PM] Navneet: I also got this offer
[22/04/20, 3:29:12 PM] Navneet: From Schlumberger
[22/04/20, 3:31:56 PM] Navneet: Of voluntory resignation....
[22/04/20, 3:37:48 PM] Nishant: Yes..these are private companies and are entitled to hire or fire whatever be the case...a reason why many people are still after govt jobs
[22/04/20, 3:38:42 PM] Nishant: Fuck
[22/04/20, 3:38:49 PM] Navneet: I know this....
But during this crisis time, will govt do anything?
[22/04/20, 3:40:05 PM] Nishant: I don't think so..if condition goes worse..they will cut down pays of govt employees or delay salary by a month or two
[22/04/20, 3:42:05 PM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai tabhi to pehle log Govt job prefer karte the
[22/04/20, 3:42:34 PM] Nishant: I read that they fired 400 people in North America...took back offers in Bombay and Delhi...however for Kanpur..they mentioned that they will give a reduced pay offer
[22/04/20, 3:43:10 PM] Nishant: But in the same article...it was mentioned they won't be firing employees from what I could understand
[22/04/20, 3:44:02 PM] Nishant: Reddy also said that employees across the top management have already taken a pay cut due to the Covid-19 crisis. “We have a longstanding relationship with the IITs. I am from IIT-Bombay. Recruiting from IITs is a continuous process for us. At this point in time, when we are doing business restructuring, it’s just not fair to our current employees. We have to take care of them first. It’s as simple as this.”

[30/04/20, 5:05:56 PM] Hitesh: I didn't like the massive media coverage they had outside shamshan ghat for Rishi kapoor and neglected Irfan

I agree their family had 3 generations of ties with bollywood and he was way senior than Irfan

But still
[30/04/20, 5:46:09 PM] Harsh Singhal: Bhai sorry but
Rishi Kapoor was far more popular, famous than Irrfan
(I am noone to compare)
[30/04/20, 5:46:52 PM] Hitesh: I said senior in terms of acting only bro
[30/04/20, 5:47:18 PM] Navneet: But as far as our youth is concerned, youth is taking more in Irrfan's death
[30/04/20, 5:47:30 PM] Navneet: Like their personal loss
[30/04/20, 5:48:05 PM] Navneet: bcz irrfan was not part of any generation who already in the Bollywood
[30/04/20, 5:48:43 PM] Navneet: he is self made star...& in terms of acting, noone is parallel to him....
[30/04/20, 5:50:28 PM] Harsh Singhal: But bro
Irrfan was not that famous
If you compare him with Rishi Kapoor
[30/04/20, 5:51:27 PM] Harsh Singhal: I dont think so
There are many
But yup
He was one of the best

[30/04/20, 5:58:16 PM] Harsh Singhal: (Rishi ka time par Hollywood India mai famous nhi tha)
[30/04/20, 6:04:38 PM] Sparsh Jain: Rishi commercial actor tha, apme time ka lover boy
[30/04/20, 6:04:46 PM] Sparsh Jain: Bahut farq padta hai usse

[30/04/20, 6:08:07 PM] Hitesh: Haan yahi toh

You all will be happy & surprised to hear that our Hina Khan aka Shreya Ghosal aka Sparsh Jain cleared CAT with 99.83 percentile.....
Today he got the offer letter from IIM-B....

He sets a clear example of "Work hard in silence, let your success make Noise🎺🎺🎺🎷"

#From_ONGC_to_IIM-B
#NoMoreSarkariBabu😛😛

The best part is (as per me😜) that he'll be going to enjoy the college life again.

[10/05/20, 11:54:47 PM] Harsh Singhal: Who are you to call it a chutiyapa
[10/05/20, 11:54:48 PM] Abhishek Pathak: YouTube pe content banana is like thoda to hai Yaar mushkil.

Then tiktok pe bhi dekhke to easy hi Lagta hai, but Maine banane Ka try Kara hai, pro video banane m time n thought dono Lagta h
[10/05/20, 11:57:04 PM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, sure, but the issue here is actually the people who are fighting. I’ve seen some stuff from both of them... Youtube definitely trumps over TikTok, simply based on the editing and quality of videos, not to mention content
[10/05/20, 11:57:17 PM] Abhishek Pathak: @918439393363 is a YouTube content creator - usse pooch sakhte hain, matlab YouTube pe sabse difficult to mujhe editing hi Lagta h Yaar.
[10/05/20, 11:57:50 PM] Abhishek Pathak: YouTube content needs some additional work n effort, correct.
[10/05/20, 11:59:08 PM] Rakshit Jain: Exactly. And tiktok is based on views and just the simple concept of making some money while doing some shit you want.... Youtube content can’t be repititive usually, unlike tiktok which is majorly a trend following community
[10/05/20, 11:59:16 PM] Sparsh Jain: Tiktok is degrading the quality of content and entertainment out there. It's mostly cringeworthy stuff which people watch to make fun of... Some of it might be good but not most

[10/05/20, 11:59:58 PM] Nishant: Probably the reason I call it a chitiyapa
[11/05/20, 12:00:16 AM] Nishant: Fully agreed
[11/05/20, 12:00:33 AM] Sparsh Jain: People are measuring their self worth on the basis of the responses and are going downer by day for that addiction... That is something scary
[11/05/20, 12:01:01 AM] Rakshit Jain: Haan, but it’s upto us what we want to see or not.... And for a country like india jahan internet common kaafi recently hua hai, tiktok is an easier way to entertain us.... but definitely, it’s content is very far away from good quality entertainment
[11/05/20, 12:02:23 AM] Sparsh Jain: Obviously the platform is not bad, its bad usage is to blame... But in the bigger picture, it is chutiyapa
[11/05/20, 12:04:32 AM] Harsh Singhal: Might be
But my views are a bit different

All of us were interested in joining ITC
ITC is manufacturing cigarettes
Which is ruining a good number of lives

And one more thing
If there are 10 IITians
3 works for betterment of the society and environment
7 indirectly harm this planet
[11/05/20, 12:08:52 AM] Pareek: Analogy is good. UPSC v IIT

[13/05/20, 1:32:48 AM] Nishant: Picture of US looks so rosey from the outer world...or maybe it's the leadership which makes things look gloomy there
[13/05/20, 6:03:52 PM] Sparsh Jain: Hey people... Bangalore or Calcutta, which one is preferrable?
[13/05/20, 6:04:05 PM] Sparsh Jain: P. S.: A mein nahi hua😢
[13/05/20, 6:09:20 PM] Nishant: Based on what I have heard...Calcutta if you want to grow in finance..else Bangalore

IIMB- mein I guess kaafi experienced log milenge,

You can ask only one que & you need to find out behind which door that lion is....

The Chinese operations act more of as a subsidiary to the parent US company.

[04/07/20, 9:53:37 PM] Abhishek Pathak: I watched Avengers Endgame after a long time -> had some doubts:

- when the final battle is going on - and the gauntlet is being transfered from clint -> black panther -> spiderman -> captain marvel ->why couldnt she wear it and destroy thanos & his entire army, basically jo iron man ne end mein kara tha, woh captain marvel thoda pehle hi kar sakhti thi, I guess she might have survived

- last scene -> cap stayed in the past, so when he marries Peggy, her daughter (in the original timeline)- Sharon Carter would have never been born, but she played an important role in helping cap during civil war and winter soldier -> how will that play out in the new reality ?

[07/07/20, 11:46:57 AM] Hitesh: Yaar pata nahi aisa lag raha ki they did this not because of incapability of redesigning the UI
Rather they know that people are highly acclaimatized to using whatsapp wala UI

Toh they must have thought ki jab dekhne me same lagenge toh jyada users ko ease hoga transition me...
I mean no resistance from user side

Thoughts?

[07/07/20, 11:49:22 AM] Harsh Singhal: FB ka 10% stake hai Jio mai
[07/07/20, 11:51:24 AM] Harsh Singhal: Jio WhatsApp ko he kyu use nhi kar raha then
[07/07/20, 11:52:10 AM] Shubham Jamdade: What is the incentive to shift to JioChat
[07/07/20, 11:54:10 AM] Shubham Jamdade: I think they will improvise it by adding daily grocery shopping, payment and some other things 
I dont know I have heard something like this but dont know where
[07/07/20, 11:54:39 AM] Pareek: Vaise resistance vali baat to theek hai, still it is ridiculous to blatantly copy UI
[07/07/20, 12:00:48 PM] Shubham Jamdade: I am thinking Mr. Ambani would give some free money to people for using it 
Just like that downloading google pay thing back in college 😂
[07/07/20, 2:25:13 PM] Abhishek Pathak: I m also coming across posts - ki Jio copied Zoom interface with an intent ki bahot log isko share karenge - to try and troll the platform and basically u get free word of mouth/eye balls :)
[07/07/20, 2:26:24 PM] Abhishek Pathak: Similar to what Musk did with Tesla Truck last year -when the he threw a stone and the window broke and it became a talking points.

Next thing we know ki he sold a couple of thousands of those trucks within 4-5 days

[13/07/20, 1:00:08 PM] Hitesh: I don't see any illogical thing here
😅

I have seen people, even some of my school friends, who were a porn watcher until they are a in a relationship. According to them they can't watch/fantasize any other woman except the woman in their life.

For them, watching porn is sort of cheating...

Naval might belong to that category, according to which, if he is watching porn now indicates that he consider himself single now and have truly moved on

😅
